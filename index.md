# Research Papers

Welcome to my research archive. This site collects my work on social chaos theory, algorithmic culture, hermeneutics, ancient textual systems, and the design of self‑hosted knowledge ecosystems. Each paper explores a different facet of how humans create, interpret, and transform information — from ancient languages to modern AI systems.

## Papers

### 1. Social Chaos, Cultural Attractors, and Algorithmic Mediation  
**Status:** In preparation  
A theoretical framework for understanding how algorithmic systems (recommendation engines, LLMs, generative models) influence the structure of social chaos and cultural formation. This paper develops a comparative model drawing on ancient hermeneutic traditions and modern computational dynamics.

**PDF:** _Coming soon_

### 2. Ancient Texts as Cultural Algorithms: Hermeneutics, Meaning, and Social Order  
**Status:** Drafting  
An analysis of how ancient societies used textual traditions to regulate social chaos, transmit norms, and generate cultural coherence. This paper compares ancient interpretive systems with modern algorithmic mediation, highlighting structural parallels between sacred texts and computational filters.

### 3. Project X: A Self‑Hosted Ecosystem for Transforming Personal Data into Structured Knowledge  
**Status:** In preparation  
A systems‑level description of Project X, a modular, privacy‑first platform for converting unstructured personal data into meaningful, interconnected knowledge structures. This paper outlines the architecture, design principles, and theoretical motivations behind the system.

**PDF:** _Coming soon_

### 4. Future Directions: Quantum Networks, Entanglement, and the Evolution of Cultural Transmission  
**Status:** Concept note  
A speculative exploration of how quantum networking and non‑classical communication channels might reshape the future of personal data sovereignty, cultural formation, and distributed knowledge systems.

**PDF:** _Coming soon_
