# Research Papers

This archive presents my ongoing work on social chaos theory, algorithmic culture, hermeneutics, ancient textual systems, and the design of self‑hosted knowledge infrastructures. The papers collected here examine how humans create, interpret, and transform information across historical, technological, and computational contexts.

## Texts

(### 1. A Brief History of Datacentral)[https://github.com/datacentral-creator/Datacentral/blob/main/Theory/History.md]
**Status:** Live  
A historical and conceptual overview of Datacentral, outlining its origins, motivations, and the intellectual trajectory that led to its development.  
**PDF:** _Not available_

---

### 2. Social Chaos, Cultural Attractors, and Algorithmic Mediation  
**Status:** In preparation  
A theoretical investigation into the ways algorithmic systems—such as recommendation engines, LLMs, and generative models—shape the dynamics of social chaos and cultural formation. The paper develops a comparative framework informed by ancient hermeneutic traditions and contemporary computational paradigms.  
**PDF:** _Coming soon_

### 3. Ancient Texts as Cultural Algorithms: Hermeneutics, Meaning, and Social Order  
**Status:** Drafting  
An analysis of how ancient societies employed textual traditions to regulate social behaviour, transmit norms, and generate cultural coherence. The paper draws structural parallels between hermeneutic interpretation and modern algorithmic mediation, examining both as systems for producing and constraining meaning.  
**PDF:** _Coming soon_

### 4. Datacentral: A Self‑Hosted Ecosystem for Transforming Personal Data into Structured Knowledge  
**Status:** In preparation  
A systems‑level exposition of Datacentral, a modular and privacy‑oriented platform designed to convert unstructured personal data into structured, interconnected knowledge representations. The paper outlines the architecture, design principles, and theoretical motivations underlying the system.  
**PDF:** _Coming soon_
